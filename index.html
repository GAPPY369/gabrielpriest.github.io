    <h1>Gabe's page of the most extraordinary things</h1>
    <p>
      This is how I like to code. I code in the afternoon, but I find myself coding more in the evenings. When I code at night I feel more comfortable and more active. As I keep on coding throughout the night I turn into Minecraft Steve and scream "Chicken Jockey" so loud that even Naruto is scared and runs away. Then I chase after Naruto with Sukuna trying to chase after me as well. Then Saitama saves the day and punches all three of us back into a wormhole that takes us to 3041. THE END.
      I like to code. Like, a lot. I usually start in the afternoon when my brain is kind of awake and my fingers remember what a keyboard is. But something strange happens when the sun goes down. As the moon rises, so does my coding power. At night, I don’t just code, I ascend.
      Once it's past 9 PM, I transform. No longer just Gabe... I become CØDĘ MØNSTÊR 9000. My hoodie gains extra sleeves, my keyboard glows neon green, and I suddenly understand at least three more programming languages. I slam energy drinks like they're potions in Skyrim. My cursor starts moving on its own. I whisper to my codebase, “You are beautiful,” and it responds, “You too, champ.”
      Around midnight, things really start cooking. I feel a strange urge ... I slam my desk and shout, “CHICKEN JOCKEY!” for reasons unknown. Minecraft Steve busts through my monitor, riding a zombie chicken, screaming in binary. Naruto hears the commotion, panics, and runs for the hills. I chase him. Sukuna joins the chaos for no reason, probably bored.
      We’re all sprinting through the streets when Saitama drops from the sky, holding a giant debugging hammer. With one flick, he smacks us so hard we fly backwards in slow motion, doing cartwheels through time.
      Next thing I know, we land in the year 3041 through a wormhole . Everything is coded in smells now. I try to deploy an app and accidentally invent a new type of banana. I become CEO of GitHub for 14 minutes before falling asleep on a floating beanbag.
      And that’s why I do my best work at night.
      The end.
